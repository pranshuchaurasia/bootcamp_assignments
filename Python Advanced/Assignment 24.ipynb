In this notation, the operators follow their operands, hence removing the need for brackets to define evaluation priority. The operation is read from left to right but execution is done every time an operator is reached, and always using the last two numbers as the operands. This notation is suited for computers and calculators since there are fewer characters to track and fewer operations to execute. "
