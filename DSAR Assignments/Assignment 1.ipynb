    "Role of AI in Logistics </br> \n",
    "\n",
    "Logistics is the management of the flow of different products and resources between different locations. The evolution of AI has revolutionized the field of logistics. AI offers to automate and simplify multiple processes, thus helping companies save both time and money. Big Data, being a powerful asset is helping logistics companies to make accurate predictions and improve their performance. </br> \n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of Having AI-Powered Logistics Systems</br> \n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Smart roads </br> \n",
    "\n",
    "Smart roads increase road safety and reduce delays in the supply chain due to unfavourable weather conditions and make deliveries faster. Solar panels and LED lights are part of smart roads and are used to produce electricity and prevent roads from being slippery during winters, as they have the ability to generate heat. LED lights alert drivers about the road status by real-time optimization. Smart roads provide information that is beneficial to businesses that use them to transport their products. Roads with fibre optic sensors are connected to the internet that can analyze traffic conditions, understand the pattern and warn drivers of upcoming traffic jams accordingly. They can also sense accidents and alarm emergency services. The use of AI in logistics promotes the use of self-driving cars. The popularity of self-driving cars is growing at a fast pace. </br> \n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Better demand prediction  </br> \n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting future needs for supplies is an important aspect of the business to meet the demand of supply in the market else there will be a risk when running out of inventory and losing revenue if the company fails to generate accurate forecasts and the number of goods. Predictive analytics help by understanding customer demand by analyzing the data and applying the analytical test to them. AI can help by predicting trends in markets and generating better forecasts than human experts, resulting in lower inventory and easier warehouse management. </br> \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Enhanced customer experience </br> \n",
    "\n",
    "AI helps in enriching customer experience through product recommendations based on users' purchasing habits and personal preferences and thus customers become more loyal to the brand as they receive a more personalized service. </br> \n",
    "\n",
    "  4. Warehouse automation </br> \n",
    "\n",
    "AI is changing warehousing processes such as data collection, and inventory processing. First, AI is used to predict product demand. Secondly, the company supplies high-demand commodities to warehouses, saving money on transportation. This technology enables the goods to be identified and organized properly. Computer vision will help in managing quality control in the future without the need for human intervention. Furthermore, if the supply chain includes multiple warehouses, AI will help to determine the optimal solution for transferring the inventory. </br> \n",

    " Every major company in the field is warming up to the potential impact of AI. A recent survey showed that more than 92% of the current oil and gas companies have already invested or plan to invest in AI. More than 50% of industry executives attest to the fact that they have already started using AI to solve their nagging concerns.</br> \n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly, AI can refer to a framework involving machine learning, natural language processing, neural networks, autonomics, and various other related systems. The use of machine learning is transforming oil and gas discovery because of the ability to gather and process large amounts of real-time data. AI can substantially reduce unplanned downtime and optimize production to increase revenue. From geological data analyzing upstream to customer engagement downstream, AI is starting to make its’ presence felt in the oil and gas industry.</br> \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Analytics and Exploration </br> \n",
    "\n",
    "AI-powered data analytics can help companies discover new exploration opportunities. In the upstream sector, AI-augmented solutions can help search for underground or underwater gas fields and crude oil. Recently ExxonMobil announced a partnership with MIT for the design of robots to help improve natural oil detection. These AI-powered robots will help detect natural oil seeps efficiently, without risk, and with minimal environmental impact.</br> \n",

BP recently invested $5 million in a partnership with Belmont Technology for using their cloud-based ML platform named “Sandy” to mine geological data and compare it with historical data to identify new workflows.</br> \n",
    "\n",
    "Total S.A., a pioneer in the oil and gas industry from France, recently partnered with Google Cloud to develop AI solutions for subsurface data analysis to explore new avenues. This partnership will help their AI solutions to analyze technical documentation using NLP and examine subsurface images using computer vision technology to make their exploration of oil and gas fields much more efficient. </br> \n",

    "Offshore oil and gas companies are functioning in unpredictable environments. From corrosions to improper threading in pipelines, complex infrastructure also makes it a maintenance nightmare. </br> \n",
    "\n",
    "One estimate indicates that an offshore rig experiences about 27 days of unplanned downtime every year. Such maintenance issues can lead to more than $30 million loss per year. This situation provides tremendous potential for production optimization using predictive analytics by AI-augmented systems. AI can anticipate most equipment failures and help save a lot of unplanned downtime and maximize productivity. </br> \n",
    "\n",
    "All the major industry leaders like Royal Dutch Shell, ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, Rosneft, and Equinor have started using predictive maintenance systems to boost growth and sustainability. </br> \n",

    "While predictive maintenance can help reduce operating costs in upstream channels, predictive analytics can forecast demand in downstream channels. </br> \n",
    "3. Reduce carbon footprint and improve safety </br> \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the Deepwater Horizon oil spill? In 2010, the BP-operated Macondo prospect spilled 4.9 million barrels of oil. It is perhaps one of the biggest environmental disasters in history. Later investigations revealed that incorrect maintenance was the main reason for the disaster. While this clearly illustrates the need for predictive maintenance using AI, this also reinforces the need for taking zero chances when it comes to the carbon footprint. AI-powered computer vision solutions can also ensure worker safety by analyzing surveillance footage and sending alerts and safety recommendations to the management and the employees. </br> \n",
    "\n",
    "Shell, an industry giant, recently partnered with Microsoft to integrate Azure C3 into its offshore operations. This integration will enable their platform to improve efficiency throughout their workflow and improve employee empowerment and safety. In 2019 Aker Solutions partnered with SparkCognition to implement their ‘SparkPredict’ platform throughout their offshore facilities. SparkPredict uses machine learning to identify sub-optimal operations and detect potential failures thereby increasing worker safety and efficiency. </br> "
